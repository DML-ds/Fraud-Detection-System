# üõ°Ô∏è Fraud Detection System

## üîç Overview
Fraudulent transactions are a major threat to financial institutions, e-commerce platforms, and consumers. The aim of this project is to develop a fraud detection system adopting machine learning techniques that can accurately recognize fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives. This model is trained on an open source dataset and deployed as a live API for credit card fraud detection.

## üõ† Tools Used

- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn)
- Machine Learning (Random Forest, SMOTE)
- Flask API for deployment

## Setup & Installation
- Creating the virtual environment in IDE terminal & Installing Dependencies
```
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```
